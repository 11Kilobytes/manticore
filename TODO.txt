-- Separate out the frontend
X Remove everything after SXML

-- Combine frontends
Push the MLton frontend sources into the src/tools/mc directory
Create a new combined mlton-main/swp-driver SML file to be the root of the SMLNJ
image created during the compilation
Disable everything Manticore before BOM

-- Tie the compilers together
Convert SXML to BOM

-- Build more stuff
Bring the mlton/basis-library into lib/basis
Stub in the C functions required from mlton/runtime/basis
Build from a single Makefile (w/ just Manticore's runtime)

-- Initial test: basic SML
Run simple SML programs through the the full compiler
Maybe get the mlton/regression & mlton/benchmark directories running

-- Later
Begin integrating Manticore language features into the MLton frontend
Add Manticore basis functions into the library
Add Manticore regression tests to the regression library

-- Much later
Manticore benchmarks

-- Much much later

mlnlffigen directory
