New BOM issues

1) it looks like we need to have some sort of “polymorphic” datatype
   to deal with HLOps before they have been instantiated.  Unclear how
   those will connect to ML datatypes.

2) should “noreturn” be part of the type system (we could introduce
   a T_Void to model this in BOM), or should it just be an attribute
   of specific functions that have a “()” return type?

3) Should data constructor arguments be flattened when translating from
   SXML to BOM?  What about Data constructors in the BOM EL?

4) Do we need the type kinds?  They depend on choosing representations
   for datatypes, which will happen later.

5) Do we need to have unsigned raw types?  The old version of Manticore
   did not, but it may be useful for representing SML Word types (or we
   could keep the distinction to the operators as before).

6) The MLton frontend gathers all exceptions into a single datatype
   in the ImplementExceptions phase (see mlton/xml/implement-exceptions.fun).
   We need to make sure that this datatype is mapped to the BOMExn.tyc
   datatype.
