** Separate out the frontend
X Remove everything after SXML

** Combine frontends
X Push the MLton frontend sources into the src/tools/mc directory
X Get Manticore running the parse->Sxml chain
X Bring the mlton/basis-library into lib/basis

** Tie the compilers together
Convert SXML to BOM
Disable everything Manticore before BOM

** Build more stuff
Stub in the C functions required from mlton/runtime/basis

** Initial test: basic SML
Run simple SML programs through the the full compiler
Maybe get the mlton/regression & mlton/benchmark directories running

** Later
Begin integrating Manticore language features into the MLton frontend
Add Manticore basis extensions into the library (e.g. Image)
Add Manticore regression tests to the regression library
Generate constants from configure

** Much later
Manticore benchmarks
